          <h1>What is the Stump Farm Race?</h1>
          <p>
            The Stump Farm Race is a cross country race event that takes place at the Reforestation Camp in Saumico, WI. This is a fundraiser for local various charities such as Green Bay Trailblazers, Reforestation Camp, and Ashwaubenon Nordic Ski Team. This event has multiple distances, such as a 20 mile two lap, 10 mile fat bike, and 10 mile mountain bike. This race is very family friendly and very laid back. Its a great race for beginners to learn what racing is like and general racing etiquette.

              <h3>My Race</h3>
              <p>
                This was my first race in more than two years. My last race was the Marji Gesick in 2023, which was also my longest and hardest race by a wide margin. I have not raced since due to a busy schedule between work, school, and other responsibilities. But as I am finishing my degree, I signed up for the Marji Gesick race in 2026; which means I need to start training again. This Stump Farm race was my way of <I>shaking off the cobwebs</I>. Much of the demographic of this race consists of people from the Fox city area, with team participation from Pete's Garage, Broke Spoke, Suamico Bike, and Green Bay Trailblazers. So I know that I am up again hefty competition and I would most likely be in the back of the pack. My performance was about how I expected. I feel like I did well for not having been putting alot of time in the saddle or miles on the bike. I was using an older hard tail cross country bike which is more than suffice for this type of terrain, as it is a very flat cross country terrain with minimal elevation and mostly smooth with the occassional roots and sand. As the race started, the first few miles are like most races; people are finding there pace and there is passing happening, and as you get further onto the course racers spread out. The course was very fast, and due to the low temperatures and dew in the morning, the terrain was very well packed and tight. Which means there was minimal loose sand and I didn't have to worry about sliding out around corners. Overall, I enjoyed it and it was a great way to introduce myself back into the mountain bike racing and training community. I was pleasantly suprised at the comradery and being able to push some of the youth to dig deep at the end too. I finished the 10.81 mile course in an hour and seven minutes with an average speed of 9.7 mi/h. I will be excited to see how I progress through this year, and after finishing the Marji Gesick next September, going back to the Stump Farm Race to see how much faster I am.
